      "guidance": "Use High Contrast: Choose text colors that stand out clearly from the background. This helps people with low vision read the content easily. You can check contrast using online tools like WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker or TPGi's Colour Contrast Analyzer.\nCommon Color Blindness: Red/Green, Blue/Yellow. If those colors are used, there should also be words or different patterns to distinguish in a way other than color.\nAvoid Italics for Large Text Blocks: Italics can be harder to read on screens. Use bold or color to highlight key points instead.\nUse Colors Thoughtfully: Avoid overly bright colors or text-background combinations that make reading difficult."

      "guidance": "Choose the Right Font and Size: Text should use simple, easy-to-read fonts large enough to read from a reasonable distance. If people are walking by quickly, they should still be able to catch the message.\nKeep it Simple: Use clear and straightforward language. Short sentences and simple words make content easier to understand that can be read within 15 seconds.\nStick to Simple Fonts: Use one or two easy-to-read typefaces. Avoid fancy or decorative fonts like Comic Sans or handwriting styles.\nGive Text Room to Breathe: Don't cram too much text into one slide. Leave space around text and images for clarity.\nAvoid long website URLs that are hard to remember.\nUse simple, recognizable links or QR codes that are large enough to easily scan to direct people to more information."

      "guidance": "Use Graphics Wisely: Supplement text with simple, clear images that reinforce the message. Avoid overly complex designs. Size appropriately, and ensure they are clear.\nUse Properly Licensed Content: Do not use copyrighted images or logos without permission.\nFollow Brand Guidelines: Use official brand resources to ensure your department or organization is recognizable.\nUse Authentic Images: Avoid generic stock photos that don't reflect the real audience or environment."
